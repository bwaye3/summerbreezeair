You can perform some quick checks before you CAll us to come to your {{ title }} location, to see if it’s something that you can handle yourself. If the air conditioning system is not running at all, check the settings on your thermostat. Make sure it’s not turned to the “off” position.

Conversely, if you’re not getting heat, is the thermostat turned to the “heat” position and is it set for a warmer temperature than the room temperature? Has a fuse or breaker flipped off? If none of these checks solve the problem it’s time to cakk the experts at SummerBreeze Heating and Air Conditioning.
