    that you can handle yourself. If the air conditioning system is not running at all, check the settings on your
    thermostat. Make sure it’s not turned to the “off” position. Is it turned to the “AC” position and is it set for a
    cooler temperature than the room temperature so it will trigger the air conditioner to turn on? Conversely, if
    you’re not getting heat, is the thermostat turned to the “heat” position and is it set for a warmer temperature than
    the room temperature? Has a fuse or breaker flipped off? If none of these checks solve the problem it’s time to call
    the experts at SummerBreeze Heating and Air Conditioning.</p>
